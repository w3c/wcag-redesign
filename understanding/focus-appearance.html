                  <p>Where a user interface component has active sub-components, if a sub-component receives
                     a focus indicator, these requirements may be applied to the sub-component instead.</p>
                  <p>Exceptions:</p>
                  <ul>
                     
                     <li>The focus indicator is determined by the user agent and cannot be adjusted by the
                        author, or</li>
                     
                     <li>The focus indicator and the indicator's background color are not modified by the author.</li>
                     </ul>
                  <p class="note">Note: Examples of sub-components that may receive a focus indicator are menu items
                     in an opened drop-down menu. However, it may also be possible to indicate user interaction
                     for such sub-components by relying strictly on a visual indication of which item is
                     <em>selected</em>. Where selectable sub-components have no differentiated focus indicator, the visual
                     indicator for sub-component selection is measured against <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/non-text-contrast.html">1.4.11 Non-text Contrast</a> requirements, not against this Criterion.</p>
                  <p class="note">Note: Contrast calculations can be based on colors defined within the technology (such
                     as HTML, CSS and SVG). Pixels modified by user agent resolution enhancements and anti-aliasing
                     can be ignored.</p>

               <h2>Intent</h2>
               <p>The purpose of this Success Criterion (SC) is to ensure a keyboard focus indicator
                  is clearly visible and discernible. Focus Appearance is closely related to <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/focus-visible.html">2.4.7 Focus Visible</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/non-text-contrast.html">1.4.11 Non-text Contrast</a>. Where Focus Visible merely requires a visible focus indicator, this SC defines a
                  minimum level of visibility. Where Non-text Contrast requires a component to have
                  adequate contrast against the background in each of its states, this SC requires sufficient
                  contrast for the focus indicator itself.</p>
               <p>For sighted people with mobility impairments who use a keyboard or keyboard-like device
                  (such as a switch or voice input), knowing the current point of focus is very important.
                  Visible focus must also meet the needs of users with low vision, who may also be keyboard-only
                  users.</p>
               <p>A keyboard focus indicator can take different forms. This Success Criterion lists
                  two ways to achieve a sufficient focus appearance. The first involves three primary
                  considerations for the entire focus indicator. A second way of achieving sufficient
                  focus appearance is by meeting similar considerations for an area of the focus indicator.
                  This Understanding document will elaborate on each of the three primary considerations,
                  then address the area considerations, and finally list some user agent exceptions.</p>

                  <h3>Encloses</h3>
                  
                  <p>The first of the focus indicator bullets states that the focus indicator "encloses"
                     the user interface component. This is defined to mean "solidly bounds or surrounds."
                     Both <em>bounds</em> and <em>surrounds</em> describe optimal and established ways of showing focus. <em>Bounds</em> and its related term "bounding box" generally describe a rectangle drawn around the
                     outside of a user interface component. It is the most common form of focus indication
                     and is sometimes referred to as a "focus rectangle."</p>

                  <p>"Surrounds" also refers to something that solidly encloses a shape. However, a shape
                     can be surrounded in many ways. For instance, the focus indicator may follow the outline
                     of the object being enclosed. The difference between <em>bounds</em> and <em>surrounds</em> is illustrated in the following two images of a set of ratings stars. In both examples,
                     the same three stars have already been selected, and focus is on the third star.</p>

                     dashed or dotted line, it cannot meet this primary consideration. However, a non-solid
                     line can still pass if it meets the wording of the exceptions (discussed in more detail

                     does not directly abut the component or any other object -- as in all preceding examples

                     is the recommended way of creating a more visible focus indicator. However, where
                     authors choose to position the indicator so it is directly next to or overlaps another
                     shape, it must contrast 3:1 against this adjacent shape as well.</p>

                  <p>The preamble to this SC is "When a user interface component has keyboard focus..."
                     The <em>keyboard focus</em> is the point of interaction for someone using a keyboard. For environments with a
                     keyboard-operable interface, the keyboard focus can be moved around the interface
                     in order to interact with different components. Whichever component is being interacted
                     with has focus.</p>
                  
                  
                  <p>WCAG defines <em>user interface component</em> as "a part of the content that is perceived by users as a single control for a distinct
                     function." Because different users may perceive controls differently, there is a potential
                     for some variation when interpreting what constitutes both a <em>single control</em> and a <em>distinct function</em>. This is particularly the case when something visually presents in a way that may
                     differ from how it is programmatically created under the covers. Where there is not
                     a native HTML component upon which to base designs, there can be great variations
                     in how the components and their focus indicators are portrayed. Further, some components
                     have sub-components that can take focus, such as the menu items on a menu.</p>
                  
                  <p> Nonetheless, consistent results from different testers were obtained for this SC
                     by using the focus indicator itself as the gauge of what constitutes the component
                     being interacted with. For complex components, the three typical focus indicators
                     are as follows:</p>
                  
                  
                  <ul>
                     
                     <li>Focus indicator around only the whole component</li>
                     
                     <li>Focus indicators around both the component and subcomponent</li>
                     
                     <li>Focus indicator around only the subcomponent</li>
                     </ul>
                  
                  
                  <p>Each of these will be discussed, using a tablist as a familiar complex component.</p>
                  
                  
                  <h3>Focus indicator around only the whole component</h3>
                  
                  <figure id="component-complex-whole">
                     <img src="img/component-complex-whole.png" alt="Three tab buttons shown with a dark blue rectangle around all three tab buttons." />
                     
                     <figcaption> A tablist with a focus indicator around only the whole.</figcaption>
                     </figure>    
                  
                  
                  <p>When the focus indicator is shown only around the whole tablist, the user is guided
                     to considering the tablist as a single user component. The tab items within it are
                     visually distinguished between selected and unselected states (and visual indicators
                     of selection state must meet the criteria given in <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/non-text-contrast.html">1.4.11 Non-text Contrast</a>).</p>
                  
                  
                  <p>Having a focus indicator <em>only</em> around the whole is possible where there is no need to have a selected sub-component
                     while another sub-component has focus. For a tablist which synchronizes its tab panel
                     content with whatever tab is active, only one tab item can be selected at a time,
                     and since whatever tab is selected is considered active, a separate focus indicator
                     is redundant.</p>
                  
                  
                  <p>Result: the group focus indicator must meet the requirements of this SC.</p>
                  
                  
                  <p>A <a href="https://codesandbox.io/s/practical-cori-nl4pld?file=/index.html">radio button group</a> and a <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/example-index/slider/slider-rating.html">star-rating widget</a>, which each use only a whole-component focus indicator, provide working examples
                     of different complex components that pass the primary requirements of this SC. In
                     the star ratings example, users can increment the rating by 1/2 stars. Not only is
                     a focus indicator for each 1/2 star unnecessary, but it would actually be difficult
                     to achieve without making the interaction confusing.</p>

                        unselected tab.</figcaption>
                     </figure>    
                  
                  
                  <p>For a tablist which does not keep its tab panel content synchronized with whatever
                     tab is selected, there needs to be a focus indicator for the tab item subcomponent.
                     This is because the tab item with focus may be different than the selected item.</p>
                  
                  <p>The user can navigate to the tablist, which in this implementation has a focus rectangle
                     around the whole tablist as well as one around a tab item (conventionally the item
                     that is currently selected). The focus around the whole is helpful in cueing a keyboard
                     user that this is a complex component that has its own interaction. The user can then
                     move focus between the unselected and selected tab items -- each of which in turn
                     has its own focus indicator -- before activating one, which then makes it selected
                     as well as focused, and updates the tab panel to match.</p>
                  
                  <p>In this scenario, either the group focus indicator or the sub-component indicator
                     must meet the requirements of this Success Criterion. To avoid being overly prescriptive,
                     the Success Criterion allows authors to choose which makes the most sense. Generally,
                     if a sub-component focus is necessary, it should be assessed instead of the group
                     indicator.</p>
                  
                  
                  <p>Result: the focus indicator for the tab item meets the requirements of this SC. The
                     tablist focus indicator does not need to meet the requirements.</p>

                     focus for the subcomponent. In this case, the thumb slider sub-component has a focus
                     indicator of sufficient size and contrast to pass the exception. There is also a subtle
                     focus around the whole slider component, but it does not need to be assessed to pass
                     this SC.</p>

                  <p>The same unsynchronized tablist can also be implemented as something which only shows
                     focus on the tab items and not on the whole. The behaviour is the same as in the prior
                     example, but there is never a focus indicator placed around the tablist. This interaction
                     is acceptable, but it is not best practice since it demands more understanding from
                     the user with less information. For example, some visual cues for the tablist and
                     tab items (and tab panel) may not be clear. As well, keyboard users may not initially
                     understand the expected keyboard interaction.</p>
                  
                  
                  <p>Result: the focus indicator for the tab item must meet the requirements of this SC,
                     judging focus with both selected and unselected tab items.</p>

                     sufficient contrast to pass the exception language of this SC.</p>
                  
                  
                  <h3>Where something with focus is not a user interface component</h3>
                  
                  <p>Some pages contain very large editing regions, such as web implementations of word
                     processors and code editors. Unlike a <code>textarea</code> element, which is a user interface component, these large editing regions do not
                     typically meet the definition of <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wcag/guidelines/22/#dfn-user-interface-components">user interface components</a>; they are not "perceived by users as a single control for a distinct function." Providing
                     focus indicators around such editing regions may still be beneficial to some; however,
                     where the region is not perceived as a single control, it is not covered by this Success
                     Criterion. The web page will still need to provide a insertion point (caret indicator)
                     in such editing regions in order to meet the requirements of <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/focus-visible.html">2.4.7 Focus Visible</a>.</p>
                  
                  
                  <p>Some non-operable elements can take focus (such as a heading element that is the target
                     of a skip link). However, the preamble of this SC refers to user interface components;
                     it is only when the element with focus is operable by keyboard that this Success Criterion
                     applies.</p>

                              component, or is at least as large as a 4 CSS pixel thick line along the shortest
                              side of a minimum bounding box of the unfocused component</li>
                           </ul>

                     <p>The first of these bullets defines a minimum area for the focus indicator using a
                        calculation for perimeter, and a secondary minimum based on the shortest side of the
                        control. It does not restrict where the indicators are placed, it is just providing
                        two methods to calculate a minimum area.</p>
                     
                     
                     <p>For the first calculation, the minimum area of the focus indicator must be at least
                        as large as the area of a 1 CSS pixel thick perimeter (border) of the control in its
                        unfocused state. The indicator does not have to be a border, but the indicator's area
                        must be at least as large. For example, if a control is a rectangle of 90px wide and
                        30px tall, the size of the outer border is 90 + 90 + 30 + 30 = 240 CSS pixels. You
                        then must subtract the 4 corner pixels (which are counted twice, both horizontally
                        and vertically), for a total minimum area of 236 CSS pixels.</p>
                     
                     
                     <p class="note">A <a href="#dfn-css-pixel">CSS pixel</a> is what developers use in CSS declarations like “width: 200px”. It is device-independent
                        and not to be confused with device pixels which vary depending on the physical pixel
                        density. <br />

                     <p>The following 3 examples use a 90px wide by 30px tall button, therefore the surface
                        area requirement is 236px (240px minus corner 4 pixels). The middle button is focused
                        in each example.</p>

                           (236px minus 2px on each side), but using a 2px thick indicator means it is well over
                           the minimum requirement of 236px squared.</figcaption>

                        <figcaption> Passes: the thick (3px) yellow underline, at 80px almost as long as the longest edge,

                     <p>If controls change size across different variations of a page (e.g., in a responsive
                        design), it helps to use a proportionally sized indicator such as an outline or background
                        change. In that way you can be sure of meeting the size requirement.</p>
                     
                     
                     <p>Another way of achieving the area requirement is to alter the appearance of the entire
                        component, for instance by changing its color. This can be effective in a set of closely
                        placed buttons. The following example using the same set of 5 ratings stars given
                        in the first illustrations in this document, shows how this can be achieved. However,
                        it is much more difficult to detect such a focus indicator when components are not
                        near each other and so cannot be easily compared. For users using magnfication, even
                        components relatively close together may be difficult to compare, so it is not considered
                        a best practice.  </p>

                     <p>The Success Criterion includes an alternative size measure of "at least as large as
                        a 4 CSS pixels border along the shortest side". This is included to allow for smaller
                        but thick indicators. For example, some controls might be of a fixed height but variable
                        width, in which case this measure allows for a more consistent approach.</p>

                        <li>A 1 CSS pixel dotted outline around the whole component would <strong>not pass</strong> the size requirement, as it is roughly 50% of the surface area of a solid line.</li>
                        
                        <li>Changing the background within a control would pass the size requirement;</li>
                        
                        <li>A 1px wide vertical line (such as a blinking cursor) would <strong>not pass</strong> the size requirement; a text input would need a larger or separate focus indicator.</li>

                     <p>The bigger the visible change when an item receives focus, the easier it is for someone
                        to see. Authors are encouraged to make the change as significant as possible, for
                        example by designing a thick border around the element. If you need to use complex
                        mathematics to work out if a focus indicator is large enough, it is probably a sign
                        that you should use a larger and proportional indicator that will provide a more visible
                        indicator.</p>

                        the focus indicator is on the edge of the size requirement. For example, if the focusable
                        control is a circle with a diameter of 100px, the circumference would be 314 pixels.
                        A 1px (or greater) outline would meet the size criterion.</p>

                     <p>If the contrast of background colors that change are close enough to need to be tested
                        for each combination then they would likely not meet the user need of people with
                        low vision in certain scroll combinations and would likely fail in certain combinations
                        as well. In these cases it would be an easy solution to use a <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/css/C40">double ring focus indicator</a> or some other mechanism to indicate focus such as a solid box with a border to guarantee
                        there is sufficient contrast across variations of background images or background
                        gradients.</p>
                     
                     <h4>Inline links</h4>
                     
                     <p>If an inline link is broken over multiple lines, some methods of creating a focus
                        indicator create different results by browsers. CSS <code>outline</code> separately surrounds each part of a link that breaks across multiple lines. It is
                        by far the most common CSS technique for focus indication, and produces a result that
                        satisfies the minimum bounding box definition (each part is solidly bound). CSS <code>border</code> will split the perimeter across the parts of the link, which results in an unenclosed
                        border for each line of the link. Such an effect still meets the area requirement
                        both since text links are inevitably longer than they are tall (thus the three sides
                        of the focus indicator are "at least as large as" four times the shortest side), and
                        since the focus indicator around links includes some padding and so exceeds the minimum
                        bounding box. Where the contrast requirements are met, each of these methods produces
                        a sufficient focus indicator.</p>

                        and thickness. For example, in most browsers a "dotted" line will have roughly half
                        the number of pixels due to gaps. However, in some sizes or browsers it might be slightly
                        less than half, so increasing the thickness may be required.</p>

                  <h3>Second exception: the default indicator and background are not modified</h3>
                  
                  <blockquote>
                     <p>The focus indicator and the indicator’s background color are not modified by the author</p>
                  </blockquote>
                  
                  <p>If the focus indicator and the background behind the focus indicator are not modified
                     by the author, the Success Criterion does not apply.</p>
                  
                  <p>The intent of this exception is to reduce burden on authors by allowing them to rely
                     on the default indicators provided by user agents (browsers). If all user agents provided
                     good focus indicators, author would be able to concentrate efforts on other accessibility
                     considerations. Unfortunately, browser default focus indicators vary by component,
                     browser, and across devices and operating systems, and the default focus indicators
                     in some browsers can be difficult to see (such as a 1px dotted outline). For this
                     reason, most authors override browser defaults in order to overcome these deficiencies
                     and create a more uniform user experience, regardless of browser.</p>
                  
                  <p>Some browser makers are improving their default focus indicators to make them more
                     visible. As more browsers adopt defaults that meet the primary bullets of this SC,
                     authors will be able to achieve improved focus indicators without customization.</p>
                  
                  
                  <h3>Modifying the focus indicator background</h3>
                  
                  <p>Browser default focus indicators can be made <em>more</em> difficult to see if the author modifies the page background color, for instance using
                     a blue background in combination with a browser's blue default indicator.</p> 
                  
                  
                  <p>[Future image set: a button with a default light blue focus indicator; the same buton
                     and focus indicator on a light blue page background]</p>
                  
                  
                  <p>As well, if the browser provides an indicator within a component by default, then
                     authors can potentially reduce the visibility by changing the component color. For
                     example, if the default indicator on a button is a bright yellow inner focus rectangle,
                     the authors can negatively affect the focus appearance by making the button yellow
                     or orange. For this reason, this user agent exception can only be met if the author
                     both does not modify the default focus indicator <em>and</em> does not modify its background. </p>
