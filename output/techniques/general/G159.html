                  <h2>Description</h2>
                  <p>The purpose of this technique is to provide an accessible alternative way of presenting
                     the information in a video-only presentation.
                  </p>
                  <p>In a video-only presentation, information is presented in a variety of ways including
                     animation, text or graphics, the setting and background, the actions and expressions
                     of people, animals, etc. In order to present the same information in accessible form,
                     this technique involves creating a document that tells the same story and presents
                     the same information as the prerecorded video-only content. In this technique, the
                     document serves as a long description for the content and includes all of the important
                     information as well as descriptions of scenery, actions, expressions, etc. that are
                     part of the presentation.
                  </p>
                  <p>If a screenplay for the video-only content was used to create the content in the first
                     place, this can be a good place to start. In production and editing however, the final
                     version often varies somewhat from the screenplay. To use the screenplay, it would
                     need to be corrected to match the final edited form of the video-only presentation.

                     <li>An animation shows how to assemble a woodworking project. There is no audio, but the
                        animation includes a series of numbers to represent each step in the process as well
                        as arrows and picture-in-picture highlights illustrating how the assembly is completed.
                        It also includes short outtake animations illustrating what will happen if assembly
                        is done incorrectly. A text alternative that identifies the video-only content reads,
                        "Breadbox assembly video (text description follows)," and the text description of
                        the video includes a full text description of each step in the video.
