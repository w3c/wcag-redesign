                  <p>The objective of this technique is to ensure that when color differences are used
                     to convey information, such as required form fields, the information conveyed by the
                     color differences are also conveyed explicitly in text.

                        Sessions for Track 1 are displayed over a blue background. Sessions in Track 2 are
                        displayed over a yellow background. Sessions in Track 3 are displayed on a green background.
                        After the name of each session is a code identifying the track in text: T1 for Track
                        1, T2 for Track 2, and T3 for Track 3.

                        Next to the title of each session is an icon consisting of a colored circle with a

                        circles with the number 3 represent Track 3. Each icon is associated with a text alternative
                        reading "Track 1," "Track 2," or "Track 3," as appropriate.

                        in red. In addition, at the end of each label is an asterisk character, *. The instructions
                        for completing the form indicate that "all required fields are displayed in red and

                              is used and to consider increasing the size of the asterisk that is presented.
