                  <h2>Description</h2>
                  <p>Web servers that require user authentication often terminate the session after a set
                     period of time if there is no activity from the user. If the user is unable to input
                     the data quickly enough and the session times out before they submit, the server will
                     require re-authentication before proceeding. When this happens, the server passes
                     (as hidden data) the information from the form into the page that is used for re-authentication.
                     Then, when the user re-authenticates, the server can use the information passed on
                     from the re-authentication page to submit the form directly or to present a page that
                     includes the data that is to be submitted for review. In this technique, the server
                     does not have to store any user-submitted data on server. This is an important technique
                     for those cases where it is either illegal or a security risk for the server to store
                     information temporarily. It also is useful in that it frees the server from having
                     to maintain the stored information and reconnect it with the newly authenticated session.

                           should consider the process used to pass the data to the re-authentication page and,
                           after re-authentication, to the page that will process the original data in order
                           to ensure that the data is protected.

                  <h2>Examples</h2>
                  <ul>
                     
                     <li>A user has logged in to use a wiki and begins editing a page. The time taken to complete
                        the edits exceeds the time allowed by the server for session inactivity. When the
                        user submits the edits, the user is notified that the session has timed out and is
                        redirected to a login page. The script that handles the original form submission passes
                        the edits as a variable to the login page and when the user successfully logs in,
                        passes the users edits back to the script that handles form submissions and the edits
                        are processed as though no session timeout had occurred.
                     </li>
                     
                     <li>A user had logged in to a secure shopping site and fills out some of the information
                        on an order form. For security reasons, the session times out after 30 mintues, but
                        the user does not submit the form until 45 minutes after loading the page. The user
                        is informed of the time out and is prompted to log-in again. If the user logs in correctly,
                        the order form is presented to the user with all of the data previously entered and
                        the user is able to review their submission and submit the form. If the log-in is
                        not successfully completed, then the form data is discarded by the server.
