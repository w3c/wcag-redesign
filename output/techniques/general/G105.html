                  <h2>Description</h2>
                  <p>Web servers that require user authentication often terminate the session after a set
                     period of time if there is no activity from the user. If the user is unable to input
                     the data quickly enough and the session times out before they submit, the server will
                     require re-authentication before proceeding. When this happens, the server stores
                     the data in a temporary cache while the user logs in, and when the user has re-authenticated,
                     the data is made available from the cache and the form is processed as if there had
                     never been a session time-out. The server does not keep the cache indefinitely, merely
                     long enough to ensure success after re-authentication in a single user session, such
                     as one day.

                  <h2>Examples</h2>
                  <ul>
                     
                     <li>A user logs in to use a forum and replies to a post. The time taken to write the reply
                        is longer than the time allowed by the server for a session of inactivity. The user
                        submits the reply and is informed of the time out and prompted to log in again to
                        submit the response. The user's post reply is retained by the server and if the user
                        log-in is successful the reply  is processed as normal. If the log-in cannot be successfully
                        completed the reply is discarded.
                     </li>
                     
                     <li>A user logs in to a secure area and fills out a form. The session times out for security
                        reasons. The form data is retained by the server and the user is informed of the time
                        out and is prompted to log-in again. If the user logs in correctly, the form is presented
                        to the user with all of the data previously entered and user can submit the form.
                        If the log-in cannot be successfully completed the form data is discarded.
