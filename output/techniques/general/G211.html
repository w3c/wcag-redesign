                  <h2>Description</h2>
                  <p>When speech input users interact with a web page, they usually speak a command followed
                     by the reference to some visible label (such as text beside an input field or inside
                     a button or link). For example, they may say "click search" to activate a button labelled
                     Search. When speech recognition software processes speech input and looks for matches,
                     it uses the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/accname/"> accessible name</a> of controls. Where there is a mismatch between the text in the label and the text
                     in the accessible name, it can cause issues for the user. The simplest way to enable
                     speech input users and meet 2.5.3 Label in Name is to ensure that the accessible name
                     matches the visible text label.
                  </p>
                  <p>Sometimes more than one text string will be positioned in the vicinity of a control
                     that could be considered a candidate for its label. For example, a set of inputs that
                     each have their own labels may also be preceded by a heading, an instruction or a
                     group label (such as an HTML legend/fieldset or an ARIA group or radiogroup). Note
                     that the term "group label" means something different than "label", both programmatically
                     and in regard to 2.5.3 Label in Name.
                  </p>
                  <p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/label-in-name">Understanding 2.5.3 Label in Name document</a> recommends that only the text string adjacent to or in close proximity to an input
                     should be treated as the label when assessing a control's label for the purposes of
                     meeting 2.5.3 (see the section "Identifying label text for components"). There are
                     both practical and technical reasons for restricting the designation of an input's
                     label in this way. The technical reasons are discussed in the Understanding document's
                     section called Accessible Name and Description Computation specification.

                  <h2>Examples</h2>
                  <p>Mapping a visible label to the accessible name is achieved in many technologies by
                     meeting <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/info-and-relationships.html"> 1.3.1 Information and Relationships</a> through the proper use of native semantics. Many controls derive accessible names
                     by correct nesting of elements, while other elements have specific attributes which
                     are a valid means of providing or referencing an accessible name.
                  </p>
                  <p>The accessible name should be assigned through native elements and semantics where
                     possible. That helps ensure an exact match between the visible label and name.

                     <p>The label for each component should be restricted to "Yes" and "No". To meet <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/info-and-relationships"> 1.3.1 Information and Relationships</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/labels-or-instructions.html"> 3.3.2 Labels or Instructions</a>, the "Call me…" text can be coded to convey the relationship to ATs, in this example
                        by using a <code>fieldset</code> and <code>legend</code>.
                     </p>
                     <p>If the label is not restricted to the string adjacent to the radio button, multiple
                        interpretations of what constitutes the label can result in less uniform functionality.
                        If "Yes" alone is not the label for the first radio button, is it "Call me when balance
                        exceeds $10,000"? Or is it a combination of text strings, in which case is the order
                        "Call me when balance exceeds $10,000 Yes" or "Yes, Call me when balance exceeds $10,000"?
                        Decisions to combine text strings can have negative effects on screen reader users
                        since the order of concatenation can affect meaning. In this example, "No, call me
                        when balance exceeds $10,000" could be very confusing to a screen reader user.

                     <p>For checkbox groupings, implementations that attempt to incorporate more than just
                        the immediate checkbox label into the accessible name can also be problematic if not
                        isolated to the adjacent text string.

                     </figure>
                     <p>In Figure 2, there is a long text string that combines a group label and instruction,
                        "What do you value in our service (check all that apply)?" Each of the checkboxes
                        also has its own one- or two-word label. In regard to 2.5.3, the labels for the components
                        should be restricted to "Courtesy", "Promptness", "Store Hours" and "Knowledge".
                     </p>
                     <p>Attempting to include the preceding text as part of the accessible name can potentially
                        make it more difficult to isolate a control by spoken commands for speech-input users.
                        Such a construction will also negatively increase verbosity for screen reader users
                        (with the combined text strings read out for each of the inputs before the input's
                        state). The simplest solution is to restrict the accessible name to the text immediately
                        beside the checkboxes, using similar techniques to those for the standard radio button
                        group.

                     <p>In Figure 3, the inputs are stacked and left-aligned, with the labels immediately
                        preceding each input, also left-aligned. There is additional white space between the
                        label and the preceding input so that the label is closest to its associated text
                        input. Stacked labels are relatively common in mobile designs, where horizontal space
                        is constrained.
                     </p>
                     <p>Figure 4 shows a variation on stacked labels, where hints and guidance are included
                        between the label and the input. This design does not provide an adjacent label. However,
                        the "New Password" label is still considered to be in close enough proximity, especially
                        given its size and boldness relative to the smaller and lower-contrast guidance text.
                        The associations are reinforced programmatically, where the hint text is given a role
                        of <code>aria-describedby</code> and the label is properly associated with the input.

                     <p>The hint text in such implementations should be kept to a single line where possible,
                        since accessibility issues can arise where a more lengthy hint separates the label
                        from its input. Figure 4 illustrates that the concept of "adjacent text" is a guide
                        for label interpretation, but cannot always serve as a hard rule.

                     <p>The two labels, "Hated it" and "Loved it", are adjacent to the first and last radio
                        buttons, and should be their accessible names. Speech-input users can speak either
                        of these labels to select a radio button, and then use arrow navigation (e.g., "Press
                        right arrow") to modify the selection. "Rate your response" is the text describing
                        the whole widget and can be associated as the group label (here using <code>legend</code>). The three middle radio buttons do not have visible labels. In the code example
                        they are given title attributes of "Disliked", "So-so" and "Liked" in order to meet
                        3.3.2 Labels or Instructions.
