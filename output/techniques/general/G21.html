                  <h2>Description</h2>
                  <p>The objective of this technique is to ensure that keyboard users do not become trapped
                     in a subset of the content that can only be exited using a mouse or pointing device.
                     A common example is content rendered by plug-ins. Plug-ins are user agents that render
                     content inside the user agent host window and respond to all user actions that takes
                     place while the plug-in has the focus. If the plug-in does not provide a keyboard
                     mechanism to return focus to the parent window, users who must use the keyboard may
                     become trapped in the plug-in content.
                  </p>
                  <p>This problem can be avoided by using one of the following mechanisms to provide a
                     way for users to escape the subset of the content:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                     
                     <li>Ensuring that the keyboard function for advancing focus within content (commonly the
                        tab key) exits the subset of the content after it reaches the final navigation location.
                     </li>
                     
                     <li>Providing a keyboard function to move the focus out of the subset of the content.
                        Be sure to document the feature in an accessible manner within the subset.
                     </li>
                     
                     <li>If the technology used in the subset of the content natively provides a "move to parent"
                        keyboard command, documenting that command before the user enters the plug-in so they
                        know how to get out again.
                     </li>
                     
                  </ul>
                  <p>If the author uses a technology that allows users to enter the sub-content with keyboard
                     and does not allow users to exit the sub-content with keyboard by default (i.e., it
                     is not a feature of the Web content technology or its user agents) then, in order
                     to implement this technique the author would either build such a capability into their
                     content or not use the technology.

                        the person from tabbing out. However, the applet is designed so that it returns keyboard
                        focus back to the parent window when the person finishes tabbing through the tab sequence
                        in the applet.
