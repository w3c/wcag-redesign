                  <h2>Description</h2>
                  <p>The objective of this technique is to provide a way to link to remote long
                     descriptions in technologies that do not have a long description feature
                     built directly into them (e.g., longdesc) or where the feature is known to
                     not be supported.
                  </p>
                  <p>With this technique, the long description is provided in another location
                     than the non-text content. This could be at another location within the same
                     URI or at another URI. A link to that long description is provided that is
                     immediately adjacent to the non-text content. The link can be immediately
                     before or after the non-text content. If the description is located along
                     with other text then put "End of description" at the end so that they know
                     when to stop reading and return to the main content. If a "Back" button will
                     not take the person back to the point from which they jumped, then a link
                     back to the non-text content location is provided.
                  </p>
                  <p>This technique was commonly used in HTML before 'longdesc' was added to the
                     specification. In HTML it was called a D-Link because it was usually
                     implemented by putting a D next to images and using the D as a link to the
                     long description. This technique is not technology specific and can be used
                     in any technology that supports links.
