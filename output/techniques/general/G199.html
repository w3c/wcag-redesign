                  <h2>Description</h2>
                  <p>The objective of this technique is to reduce the effort required for users to confirm
                     that an action, such as submitting a Web form, was completed successfully. This can
                     be accomplished by providing consistently presented feedback that explicitly indicates
                     success of an action, rather than requiring a user to navigate through content to
                     discover if the action was successful.
                  </p>
                  <p>Significant effort can be expended by users who can not easily scan through information
                     to confirm their action (such as that data submitted has been successfully entered
                     into a database, sent to a person, or added to content being edited).

                  <h2>Examples</h2>
                  <ul>
                     
                     <li>A user logs into a system and gets a response indicating that: "You have successfully
                        logged in," so they do not need to navigate through the screen to find an indicator
                        that they are logged in, such as finding their user name, or perhaps the login link
                        replaced with a logout link. Finding these cues can be time consuming.
                     </li>
                     
                     <li>A user fills in a quiz or test and submits it. The response informs them that the
                        test was successfully submitted, so that they don't need to navigate through data,
                        such as a list of submitted tests, to confirm that the test is listed there.
                     </li>
                     
                     <li>A visitor creates an account on a Web site. After submission of the form, feedback
                        suggests that "Registration was successfully submitted ...," If they are automatically
                        logged in after registration, the response also says "...and you have been logged
                        in." If confirmation is required, the feedback includes a message such as "...an email
                        has been sent to you to which you must reply to confirm your registration."
                     </li>
                     
                     <li>A user submits a form with information directed at support staff. The feedback indicates
                        that the "The message was successfully sent, and you should receive a reply within
                        the next 48 hours."
