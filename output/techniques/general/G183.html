                  <h2>Description</h2>
                  <p>The intent of this technique is to provide a redundant visual cue for users who may
                     not be able to discern a difference in text color. Color (generally defined as a combination
                     of hue, saturation and luminance) is commonly used to indicate words that are links
                     within a paragraph or other block of text. For example, scattered words in text may
                     be hypertext links that are identified only by a difference in color with surrounding
                     text. This technique describes a way to provide a difference in contrast rather than
                     relying on hue.
                  </p>
                  <p>To meet success criterion 1.4.1: Use of Color a <a href="/guidelines/#" target="terms">relative luminance</a> (lightness) difference of 3:1 or greater with the text around can be used. This technique
                     goes beyond the success criterion and asks for visual highlights when the user hovers
                     over each link, such as an underline, a change in font style such as bold or italics,
                     or an increase in font size. Such a hover effect provides confirmation to pointer
                     users that the text is a link, similar to how the link alters its appearance for keyboard
                     users when it receives focus, in order to meet <a href="../../guidelines/sc/20/sensory-characteristics.html">2.4.7 Focus Visible</a>.
                  </p>
                  <p>While using this technique is sufficient to meet this success criterion, it is not
                     the preferred technique to differentiate link text. This is because links that use
                     the relative luminance of color alone may not be obvious to people with low vision.
                     If there are not a large number of links in the block of text, underlines are recommended
                     for links in blocks of text.
                  </p>
                  <div class="note">
                     <div role="heading" class="note-title marker" aria-level="3">Note</div>
                     <div>
                        
                        <p>This technique is about the use of color in addition to luminosity. In this technique,
                           the contrast ratio refers to the contrast between a link and the words around it.
                           In Success Criterion 1.4.3 and 1.4.6, contrast ratio refers to the contrast between
                           a word and its background. The difference is that  this technique is about the ability
                           for users to tell the difference (a noticeable difference) between different pieces
                           of text whereas the contrast ratio used in success criterion 1.4.3 and 1.4.6 is about
                           the readability of the text with its background for different color and vision disabilities.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>If an author wants to use the color portion of this technique (i.e., using different
                           colors for the words where the colors have sufficient contrast with each other) and
                           the author also wants to conform to SC 1.4.3 (contrast of both words with their backgrounds)
                           the following colors can be used. (e.g., black text in a paragraph on a white background
                           with the links shown as one of the colors in example 1 below.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>If assistive technology or Web browsers at some point all provide an option to underline
                           all links on Web pages for users, this could be used instead of an author-provided
                           link highlighting mechanism.
