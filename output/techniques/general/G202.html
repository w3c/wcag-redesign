                  <h2>Description</h2>
                  <p>The objective of this technique is to provide keyboard operation for all the functionality
                     of the page. When all functionality of content can be operated through a keyboard
                     or keyboard interface, it can be operated by those with no vision as well as by those
                     who must use alternate keyboards or input devices that act as keyboard emulators like
                     speech input software or on-screen keyboards.
                  </p>
                  <p>A <a href="/guidelines/#" target="terms">keyboard interface</a> allows users to provide keystroke input to programs even if the computing device
                     that they are using does not contain a hardware keyboard. For example, many mobile
                     devices have keyboard interfaces within their operating system as well the option
                     to connect external wireless keyboards. Applications can use the interface to obtain
                     keyboard input either from an external keyboard or from other services that provide
                     simulated keyboard output, such as switch devices, handwriting interpreters or speech-to-text
                     applications.
                  </p>
                  <p>To implement this technique, first determine what functionality is available to users
                     on the page. In this step, it is important to consider functions performed using both
                     the mouse and the keyboard together. Examples of functionality include the use of
                     physical controls such as links, menus, buttons, checkboxes, radio buttons and form
                     fields as well as the use of features like drag and drop, selecting text, resizing
                     regions or bringing up context menus. Other examples of functionality may based on
                     tasks such as adding or removing an item from a shopping cart or initiating a chat
                     session with a sales representative.
                  </p>
                  <p>Once the functionality of the content has been determined, the author verifies that
                     each of the functions identified can be performed using only the keyboard.
                  </p>
                  <div class="note">
                     <div role="heading" class="note-title marker" aria-level="3">Note</div>
                     <div>
                        
                        <p>This does not necessarily mean that each of the individual controls can be used from
                           the keyboard as long as there are multiple methods to perform the same function available
                           on the page. Authors are advised to consider how users will discover any keyboard
                           equivalents which are available.

                  <ul>
                     
                     <li>A page with images used as links changes when the user hovers over the image with
                        a mouse. To provide keyboard users with a similar experience, the image is also changed
                        when a user tabs to it.
                     </li>
                     
                     <li>A page that allows users to click and drag items in a list to reorder them also includes
                        a series of controls that allows keyboard users to move items up, down or to the beginning
                        and end of the list.
                     </li>
                     
                     <li>The mobile version of a web site includes a menu button that is tapped to open a site
                        menu, which is implemented as a floating overlay. To provide access to people using
                        external keyboards or ability switches with their mobile device, the menu button and
                        the site menu are both implemented such that they can be operated via the mobile device's
                        keyboard interface.
