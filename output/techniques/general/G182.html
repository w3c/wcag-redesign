                  <h2>Description</h2>
                  <p>The intent of this technique is to provide a redundant visual cue for users who may
                     not be able to discern a difference in text color. Color is commonly used to indicate
                     the different status of words that are part of a paragraph or other block of text
                     or where special characters or graphics cannot be used to indicate which words have
                     special status. For example, scattered words in text may be hypertext links that are
                     marked as such by being printed in a different color. This technique describes a way
                     to provide cues in addition to color so that users who may have difficulty perceiving
                     color differences or have low vision can identify them.
                  </p>
                  <p>To use this technique, an author incorporates a visual cue in addition to color for
                     each place where color alone is used to convey information. Visual cues can take many
                     forms including changes to the font style, the addition of underlines, bold, or italics,
                     or changes to the font size.

                     <div>
                        
                        <p>While this technique is sufficient to meet the visual requirements of Success Criterion
                           1.4.1, the information conveyed by the color must also be available programmatically
                           to satisfy Success Criterion 1.3.1. See
                           <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/info-and-relationships">How to Meet 1.3.1</a>.

                     <li>The default formatting for links on a page includes presenting them both in a different
                        color than the other text on the page underlining them to make the links identifiable
                        even without color vision.
                     </li>
                     
                     <li>An article comparing the use of similar elements in different markup languages uses
                        colored text to identify the elements from each language. Elements from the first
                        markup language are identified using BLUE, bolded text. Elements from the second are
                        presented as RED, italicized text.
                     </li>
                     
                     <li>A news site lists links to the articles appearing on its site. Additional information
                        such as the section the article appears in, the time the article was posted, a related
                        location or an indication that it is accompanied by live video appears in some cases.
                        The links to the articles are in a different color than the additional information
                        but the links are not underlined, and each link is presented in a larger font than
                        the rest of the information so that users who have problems distinguishing between
                        colors can identify the links more easily.
                     </li>
                     
                     <li>Short news items sometimes have sentences that are also links to more information.
                        Those sentences are printed in color and use a sans-serif font face while the rest
                        of the paragraph is in black Times-Roman.
