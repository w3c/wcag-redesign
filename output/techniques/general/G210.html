                  <h2>Description</h2>
                  <p>The objective of this technique is to ensure that users who use a path-based drag-and-drop
                     action to move an item from the initial location to a drop target can abort the action
                     after picking up the target. This can be done either by releasing the item outside
                     a drop area, or by moving the item back to its original position in a separate action
                     that undoes the first action. A third option is to have a step after the element is
                     dropped onto target, either with a dialog asking for confirmation of the action when
                     the item is dropped, or providing an undo command.
                  </p>
                  <div class="note">
                     <div role="heading" class="note-title marker" aria-level="3">Note</div>
                     <p>This technique addresses pointer actions where support has been implemented by authors,
                        not gestures provided by the user agent (such as horizontal swiping to move through
                        the browser history or vertical swiping to scroll through page content) or the operating
                        system (e.g., gestures to move between open apps, or call up contextual menus of assistive
                        technologies when these are enabled).
                     </p>
                  </div>
                  <p>On touch screen devices, author-supplied path-based and multipoint gestures usually
                     do not work when OS level assistive technologies (AT) like a built-in screenreader
                     is turned on. AT generally consumes path-based or multipoint gestures so they would
                     not reach the authored content. For example, a horizontal drag gesture may not move
                     a slider thumb as intended by the author, but move the screen reader focus to the
                     next or previous element. Some gestures may work if the user operates "pass through
                     gestures" which are often unreliable as they may depend on factors of hardware, operating
                     system, operating system "skin", operating system setting, or user agent.

                  <h2>Examples</h2>
                  <ul>
                     				
                     <li>A site shows a file directory. Files can be picked up and moved over a trash can icon.
                        When the picked-up file is released outside this target, it reverts to the old position.
                     </li>
                     				
                     <li>A site shows a file directory. Files can be picked up and moved over a trash can icon
                        to delete it. When the picked-up file is released over the trash can, a modal dialog
                        asks the user to confirm or cancel the delete action.
                     </li>
                     				
                     <li>A kanban implementation of a project planning site shows different columns for phases
                        of an activity. Users can pick up and move icons representing planning items to another
                        column. When an item has been picked up and now follows the pointer, it can be moved
                        outside the drop targets (columns) and dropped there to cancel the action. The item
                        will then jump back to the old position.
                     </li>
                     				
                     <li>A kanban implementation of an issue tracking system shows columns that indicate different
                        phases in handling issues (such as new / processed / done / closed). There is no screen
                        space outside the kanban columns. Users can pick up and move icons representing issues
                        between columns. When an item has been dropped in another column, the action can be
                        reversed by dragging the icon back to the original column where it will return to
                        its original position (defined by sorting preferences).
