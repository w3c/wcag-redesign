                  <h2>Description</h2>
                  <p>Before graphics became widely used on the internet, ASCII characters were often arranged
                     to form pictures or graphs. Although ASCII art is not used frequently on the Web anymore,
                     it must be remembered that, when it is used, it is very confusing to people who are
                     blind and accessing the internet using screen readers. If it is used it should also
                     have a text explanation of what the picture is. It is also suggested that there be
                     a link to skip over the ASCII art (although this is not required).
                  </p>
                  <p>Emoticons are very popular. They include ASCII characters that form facial expressions
                     and other ways to communicate an emotion. They can be confusing for screen reader
                     users. When possible it is better simply to use a word like "smile" instead of an
                     emoticon. But if emoticons are used they should have a text alternative. In some contexts,
                     blog and forum software for example, plug-ins are available that automatically convert
                     ASCII characters used as emoticons into HTML images with text alternatives.
                  </p>
                  <p>Leetspeak uses various combinations of characters, including numerals and special
                     characters, to replace standard characters. Leet has become a part of Internet culture
                     and slang. Leet is frequently used to beat text and spam filters. It is often incomprehensible
                     to blind people using screen readers, and therefore requires a text alternative in
                     order to conform to Success Criteria 1.1.1.
                  </p>

                     <div>
                        
                        <p>Because support for this technique is limited, it is recommended that authors provide
                           the text alternative in text.
