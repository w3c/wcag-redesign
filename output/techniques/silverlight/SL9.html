                  <h2>Description</h2>
                  <p>The objective of this technique is to handle key events in a Silverlight
                     				application and enable application-specific keyboard functionality
                     				in a Silverlight application. The keyboard functionality might relate
                     				to a particular element of the Silverlight application user interface,
                     				or might be a handler for global key events within the application,
                     				such as an application-wide access key. 
                  </p>
                  <p>In Silverlight, application authors handle user input by attaching
                     				event handlers for input events. The input events are implemented on
                     				a class that is a base element in the Silverlight class hierarchy,
                     				such that all Silverlight UI elements can be the source of an input
                     				event if the user interacts with them. Typically, the event handler
                     				names are specified in XAML, although it is also possible to wire events
                     				in code. The implementation of the handlers for the Silverlight managed
                     				code programming model is always done in C# or Visual Basic code. 
                  </p>
                  <p>The most commonly used input events are the following: </p>
                  <ul>
                     
                     <li> 
                        KeyUp, KeyDown - these are the
                        				key events. Which key is pressed is determined by event parameters
                        				passed to the handler. 
                     </li>
                     
                     <li> 
                        MouseEnter, MouseOver, MouseLeave 
                        
                     </li>
                     
                     <li> 
                        MouseLeftButtonDown, MouseLeftButtonUp, MouseRightButtonDown, MouseRightButtonUp 
                        
                     </li>
                     
                  </ul>
                  <p>Other forms of input that Silverlight supports include touch devices
                     				(with mouse promotion for cases where the application runs on devices
                     				that do not have touch input modes) and a related inking mode. For
                     				any UI interaction that uses mouse input or these other input modes,
                     				Silverlight application authors can write a parallel key event handler
                     				to provide users the keyboard equivalent. 
                  </p>
                  <p>Also, the Silverlight event system and control model combine to enable
                     				behavior whereby a mouse event and a keyboard event can be treated
                     				as the same event and can be handled by a common event handler. Using
                     				this technique, Silverlight authors can facilitate keyboard functionality
                     				in custom controls or as override behavior to existing Silverlight-supplied
                     				controls, and provide equivalence for mouse events or events that are
                     				specific to other input devices. Silverlight authors can also use controls
                     				that already have a keyboard equivalence as a built-in behavior. 
                  </p>
                  <p>The parallel key event handler case, and the built-in behavior case,
                     				are each shown in one of the examples. 
                  </p>
                  <p>All input events report a specific source that is communicated to
                     				handler code as an event parameter, so that the application author
                     				can identify which element in their Silverlight UI was being interacted
                     				with, and the application can perform an action that is relevant to
                     				that user input. In the case of mouse events, the event source is the
                     				element that the mouse pointer is over at the time. In the case of
                     				key events, the event source is the element that has focus. The element
                     				that has focus is visually indicated so that the user knows which element
                     				they are interacting with (see <a href="#SL2"></a>). Assistive technologies
                     				often have parallel conventions whereby the user is made aware of which
                     				element is visually focused and is the current input scope presented
                     				by the assistive technology, 
                  </p>

                     <h3>Browser hosts and keyboard events</h3>
                     
                     <p>Silverlight is hosted as a plug-in inside a browser host. The Silverlight
                        					run-time only receives the input events that the browser host forwards
                        					to hosted plug-ins through a browser-specific program access layer.
                        					Occasionally the browser host receives input that the browser host
                        					itself handles in some way, and does not forward the keyboard event.
                        					An example is that a Silverlight application hosted by an Internet
                        					Explorer browser host on Windows operating system cannot detect a press
                        					of the ALT key, because Internet Explorer processes this input and
                        					performs the action of bringing keyboard focus to the Internet Explorer
                        					menu bar. Silverlight authors might need to be aware of browser-specific
                        					input handling models and not rely on key events for keys that are
                        					essentially reserved for use by a browser host. For more information,
                        					see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc189015(VS.95).aspx">Keyboard

                     <h3>Other event models</h3>
                     
                     <p>This technique specifically discusses event handling for the Silverlight
                        					managed programming model. However, Silverlight also supports parallel
                        					models for event handling, either through a Silverlight run-time feature
                        					or due to Silverlight's role as a plug-in within a script-capable browser
                        					host. For example, events from the HTML DOM can be handled by JavaScript
                        					at HTML scope for the overall Silverlight plug-in; this uses the browser
                        					host as script processor and the Silverlight run-time is not directly
                        					involved. Or, HTML DOM events can be handled through an HTML bridge
                        					that calls into Silverlight application code. These event models can
                        					potentially be used to provide keyboard equivalence, but it is generally
                        					more convenient to use the managed code model as described in this
                        					technique. For more information on other event models in Silverlight,
                        					see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc189018(VS.95).aspx">Events

                  <h2>Examples</h2>
                  <p>Two examples are given. The first example is for the scenario of a
                     				Silverlight application author that is simply incorporating an existing
                     				control into their application design, and is taking advantage of mouse-keyboard
                     				equivalence that is already defined by certain Silverlight core controls.
                     				The second example is from the perspective of a control author, or
                     				at least that of a Silverlight application author that intends to encapsulate
                     				behavior in a custom Silverlight control and use it in their own application.

                     <h3>Example 1: Built-in keyboard equivalence for core Silverlight controls</h3>
                     <p>This example pertains to cases where the control that handles key
                        						events is focusable (through the tab sequence, etc.) and where an existing
                        						Silverlight control behavior provides the keyboard equivalence In this
                        						example, a Silverlight UI includes a <code class="obj">Button</code> element.
                        						For sighted users, or users that generally use the mouse to interact
                        						with UI, a typical way to interact with the button is to position the
                        						mouse pointer over the element, and click the left mouse button. However,
                        						the <code class="obj">Button</code> also supports a built-in key handling behavior,
                        						whereby either the SPACE or ENTER keys are treated as an equivalent
                        						action to clicking the button with a mouse. The requirement for this
                        						interaction is that the <code class="obj">Button</code> must have keyboard
                        						focus at the point in time that SPACE or ENTER are pressed. The <code class="obj">Button</code> might
                        						gain focus because the user pressed the TAB key to move through the
                        						tab sequence, or some equivalent action enabled by assistive technology.
                        						In terms of the programming experience, the Silverlight application
                        						author does not have to separately handle KeyDown for
                        						this case. Within the <code class="obj">Button</code> control built-in code,
                        						the special case of SPACE or ENTER keys pressed while a <code class="obj">Button</code> has
                        						focus invokes the button’s Click event. Then the Silverlight
                        						application author can simply handle Click without
                        						differentiating whether the input action was a mouse click or a keyboard
                        						equivalent. The following is the entire XAML UI.

                     <p>In this example, a new Silverlight custom control named SimpleNumericUpDown
                        						uses a control template that includes two buttons. To provide keyboard
                        						equivalence for the buttons, an event handler is defined by the control
                        						class code. The event handler invokes the action in response to certain
                        						accelerator keys, where these actions are equivalent to clicking the
                        						button composition parts of the control with a mouse. The following
                        						is the default XAML template.

  &lt;/Border&gt;
&lt;/ControlTemplate&gt;
</pre><p>The following C# code shows the event handlers. Also, the code includes
