                  <h2>Description</h2>
                  <p>The objective of this technique is to use the characteristics of the
                     				XAML language to support basic parsing requirements that both applications
                     				and accessibility frameworks rely upon. This technique explains the
                     				role of XAML in the overall Silverlight development and application
                     				architecture, in particular for defining the elements that make up
                     				a Silverlight user interface. This technique also present some basic
                     				facts about XAML as a language; more information of this nature is
                     				also included in <a href="#silverlight_notes"></a>. 
                  </p>
                  <p>XAML is a markup language for object instantiation. XAML can be incorporated
                     				into a technology such as Silverlight. A specific XAML vocabulary can
                     				be defined by a technology such as Silverlight, and the vocabulary
                     				can be extended by anyone that provides suitable backing code. For
                     				example, a Silverlight application author can define a custom class,
                     				and the application author or potentially other Silverlight application
                     				authors can use XAML to instantiate instances of the custom class. 
                  </p>
                  <p>XAML has a <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=114525">published
                        				language specification</a>. 
                  </p>
                  <p>XAML does not necessarily declare the entirety of the object tree
                     				that a Silverlight client runtime loads, but XAML typically declares
                     				the majority of the objects/elements that represent the Silverlight
                     				application's user interface. The objects and values that are used
                     				for accessibility scenarios are often closely related to the standard
                     				user interface, and thus accessibility-related properties are typically
                     				declared in XAML rather than in code, even though setting the values
                     				in code is technically possible. 
                  </p>

                     <h3> XAML and XML </h3>
                     
                     <p>XAML is based on XML, and shares many of its language features. Some
                        					of the language features that are directly relevant to the stated intent
                        					of SC4.1.1 and to 4.1.1 related techniques include: 
                     </p>
                     
                     <ul>
                        
                        <li> Well-formedness: The definition of well-formed XAML is the same
                           					as the XML definition. XAML processors, including the Silverlight
                           					runtime XAML parser, will block loading XAML that is not well formed. 
                        </li>
                        
                        <li> Duplicate attributes: Unless specially configured for scenarios
                           						such as design-time support, XAML processors will block loading XAML
                           						where elements contain duplicate attributes. 
                        </li>
                        
                        <li> Quote matching: mismatched quote matching for attribute values
                           							in XAML constitutes XAML that is not well formed. 
                        </li>
                        
                     </ul>
                     
                     <p>Some XAML language features that are analogous to XML but have some
                        					technology-specific differences include: 
                     </p>
                     
                     <ul>
                        
                        <li> Identifiers: XAML defines a <code class="prop">Name</code> directive, which
                           					is analogous to <code class="att">xml:id</code> in that <code class="prop">Name</code> serves
                           					as the unique identifier of an element. However, XAML defines an
                           					additional concept of a XAML namescope, which permits a XAML document
                           					to contain multiple XAML namescopes as a factoring technique. Thus,
                           					identical <code class="prop">Name</code> values are permitted in a XAML document
                           					so long as each is defined in a separate XAML namescope. XAML namescopes
                           					are associated with elements, such that the extent of each XAML namescope
                           					is understood by XAML processors. 
                        </li>
                        
                        <li> Schemas and vocabularies: A notable difference between XAML and
                           						XML is that a XAML vocabulary is not typically represented in existing
                           						XML schema definition formats such as XSD or DTD. XAML includes inheritance
                           						and reference features that cannot adequately be expressed in XSD
                           						or other existing XML schema representation formats. This affects
                           						the "elements are nested according to their specifications"   consideration
                           						of SC4.1.1. XAML definitely has the ability to enforce nesting restrictions
                           						as represented by a XAML vocabulary. However, XAML validity for a
                           						vocabulary is deliberately fluid, in order to support extension by
                           						user code. XAML validity is determined by a combination of a XAML
                           						processor, a XAML concept known as a XAML schema context, and the
                           						code that backs the XAML and defines any objects being instantiated
                           						as a parsing result. Typically, design time tools such as Microsoft
                           						Visual Studio can adequately duplicate the runtime validity characteristics
                           						of a XAML vocabulary. Using these tools, application authors can
                           						both verify XAML validity as well as receive design-time information
                           						for how to correct any XAML validity errors. 
                        </li>
                        
                     </ul>

                     <h3> XAML parsing and HTML parsing </h3>
                     
                     <p>In the Silverlight implementation, XAML is like HTML in that it is
                        					loaded and parsed just-in-time. Silverlight XAML is not precompiled
                        					to binary or MSIL (the language-neutral CLR runtime format). Instead,Silverlight
                        					XAML is transmitted or stored as plain text, either loose or packaged
                        					as resources in a library. Thus Silverlight XAML is human readable
                        					as well as machine readable. 
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>However, unlike HTML, Silverlight XAML is only intended to be loaded
                        					and interpreted by the Silverlight runtime, rather than multiple possible
                        					user agents that each implement an HTML engine. HTML is a language
                        					where the behavior is also specified. In contrast, XAML is a language
                        					for referencing constructs that are defined in runtime libraries, and
                        					the functional specification of the XAML language itself is minimal
                        					(intrinsics; language rules; primitive types). Layout, appearance,
                        					type-member sets, roles, etc. are all left up to specific frameworks
                        					and vocabularies that use XAML. Behavior associated with a given XAML
                        					construct is based on type definitions made in a runtime library. For
                        					Silverlight XAML, the types are from Silverlight core libraries, but
                        					often the definitions come from libraries that are available to the
                        					Silverlight runtime as part of an application's packaging for distribution. 
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>XAML is generally speaking strict, and will raise parsing errors if
                        					XAML contains elements that are not recognized. Such parsing errors
                        					generally present the information in the XAML from resulting in any
                        					objects being created, which in turn prevents a Silverlight application
                        					from running. This is different from typical (non-xHTML) HTML, where
                        					implementations are permitted to contain nonrecognized elements or
                        					attributes and ignore them.

                        <p>Silverlight XAML is able to be loaded by design tools for Silverlight.
                           							In the design tool, the XAML is interpreted much like the runtime interprets
                           							it, in order to show the visual representation of the Silverlight application.
                           							In addition, the design tool might implement design surfaces in which

                           							save any changes made in the tool back into the loaded XAML.

                        <p>At design time, tools such as Microsoft Visual Studio or Microsoft
                           							Expression might provide opportunities to correct any XAML errors before
                           							the Silverlight application is compiled and packaged for deployment.
                           							This might be implemented by performing static analysis of the XAML,
                           							by forwarding the design tool's own parser errors as it renders the
                           							design surface, or by forwarding linking errors that are identified
                           							by a precompile step (for example, missing event handlers raise a XAML
                           							error from precompile). This behavior is sometimes identified as a <em>design
                              								mode</em> behavior in Microsoft documentation and other documentation
                           							about Visual Studio or specific tools. 
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>Regardless of how a given XAML file behaves while being interacted
                           							with in a design mode, it is the Silverlight runtime XAML parser on
                           							each client installation that is the ultimate determinant of whether
                           							the XAML is valid or invalid.

                           					emitted by the Silverlight plugin. XAML parse errors are forwarded
                           					to JavaScript errors and can be handled in this way. However, it is
                           					also possible that the application is production-ready, and deliberately
                           					does not expose any JavaScript errors, whether Silverlight managed
                           					code errors or not. If seeing the specific error is important, the
                           					test might need to be run against a preproduction or debug version
                           					of the application.
