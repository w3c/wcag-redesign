                  <h2>Description</h2>
                  <p>The objective of this failure is to avoid situations in which people who cannot perceive
                     color differences cannot identify links (when people with color vision can identify
                     links). Link underlines or some other non-color visual distinction are required (when
                     the links are discernible to those with color vision). 
                  </p>
                  <p>While some links may be visually evident from page design and context, such as navigational
                     links, links within text are often visually understood only from their own display
                     attributes. Removing the underline and leaving only the color difference for such
                     links would be a failure because there would be no other visual indication (besides
                     color) that it is a link.
                  </p>
                  <div class="note">

                        <p>Red and Pink are the same color (hue) but they have different lightness (which is
                           not color ).   So red and pink would pass the requirement for "not distinguished by
                           color (hue) alone" since they differ by lightness (which is not color) - as long as
                           the difference in lightness (contrast) is 3:1 or greater. For example, if surrounding
                           text is RED and the link is PINK it would pass.  Similarly a light green and a dark
                           red differ BOTH by color AND by lightness so they would pass if the contrast (lightness)
                           difference is 3:1 or greater before focus or pointing.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>There is no requirement that links be identifiable by people who cannot perceive color
                           if they are not perceivable for those with color vision. (e.g. if the links are hidden
                           for everyone â€“ as in a game or test).
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>If the non-color cue only happens when the mouse hovers over the link or when the
                           link receives focus, it is still a failure.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>If the link is a different color and bold it would not fail because the boldness is
                           not color dependent.

                     <p>A Web page includes a large number of links within the body text. The links are styled
                        so that they do not have underlines and are very similar in color to the body text.
                        This would be a failure because users would be unable to differentiate the links from
                        the body text.
