                  <h2>Description</h2>
                  <p>The objective of this Failure is to describe situations where:</p>
                  <ol> 
                     					
                     <li>Controls are set to activate functionality on the down-event of a pointer;</li>
                     					
                     <li>No further mechanism to abort or undo is available;</li>
                     					
                     <li>The up-event does not reverse the outcome of the activation;</li>
                     					
                     <li>It is not essential for the functionality to execute and complete on the down-event.</li>
                     				
                  </ol>
                  <p>Rather than taking advantage of the <code>click</code> event, authors may use down-events such as <code>mousedown</code>, <code>touchstart</code> or <code>pointerdown</code>. As a result, functionality will be executed as soon as a mouse button is pressed
                     (but not released yet), or a finger or stylus makes contact with a touchscreen.
                  </p>
                  <p>It is possible to use the down event and mitigate potential issues to avoid failing
                     the Success Criterion. For example, provide a method to easily undo or abort the functionality,
                     or reverse the outcome on the up-event (when the mouse button is released, or when
                     the finger or stylus are lifted from the touchscreen). And note that some uses of
                     the down-event are essential for the functionality (e.g., where the control simulates
                     the operation of a musical instrument like a set of piano keys, or when the control
                     is used as an on-screen control for a game where a fast and immediate response is
                     required), in which case they would not fail this Success Criterion.
                  </p>

                     <div role="heading" class="note-title marker" aria-level="3">Note</div>
                     <p>The test procedure outlined below could be supplemented with automated or semi-automated
                        tests to scan for JavaScript that registers event listeners such as <code>mousedown</code>, <code>touchstart</code>, or <code>pointerdown</code>. The automated test would not be sufficient to make a pass/fail determination, but
                        it can help narrow down the number of potentially problematic controls.

                     <h3>Example 1: A close button that triggers on down-events</h3>
                     <p>A modal dialog contains a lengthy form that a user needs to complete. The modal provides
                        a simple "Close" control that closes the dialog and loses all information the user
                        may already have entered in the form. However, instead of simply listening to the
                        <code>click</code> event - which in most user agents is triggered on the up-event - the author decided
                        to close the dialog on the down-event. This may lead to the user accidentally closing
                        the dialog and losing all the data they entered into the form up to that point.
