                  <h2>Intent</h2>
                  <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to make users aware of important changes in
                     content that are not given focus, and to do so in a way that doesn't unnecessarily
                     interrupt their work.
                  </p>
                  <p>The intended beneficiaries are blind and low vision users of assistive technologies
                     with screen reader capabilities. An additional benefit is that assistive technologies
                     for users with cognitive disabilities may achieve an alternative means of indicating
                     (or even delaying or supressing) status messages, as preferred by the user.
                  </p>
                  <p>The scope of this Success Criterion is specific to changes in content that involve
                     status messages. A <a href="#dfn-status-message">status message</a> is a defined term in WCAG. There are two main criteria that determine whether something
                     meets the definition of a status message:
                  </p>
                  <ol>
                     		
                     <li> the message <q>provides information to the user on the success or results of an action, on the waiting
                           state of an application, on the progress of a process, or on the existence of errors;</q></li>
                     		
                     <li> the message is not delivered via a change in context.</li>
                     	
                  </ol>
                  <p>Information can be added to pages which does not meet the definition of a status message.
                     For example, the list of results obtained from a search are not considered a status
                     update and thus are not covered by this Success Criterion. However, brief text messages
                     displayed <em>about</em> the completion or status of the search, such as "Searching...", "18 results returned"
                     or "No results returned" would be status updates if they do not take focus. Examples
                     of status messages are given in the section titled <a href="#status-examples">Status Message Examples</a> below.
                  </p>
                  <p>This Success Criterion specifically addresses scenarios where new content is added
                     to the page without changing the user's context. <a href="#dfn-changes-of-context">Changes of context</a>, by their nature, interrupt the user by taking focus. They are already surfaced by
                     assistive technologies, and so have already met the goal to alert the user to new
                     content. As such, messages that involve changes of context do not need to be considered
                     and are not within the scope of this Success Criterion. Examples of scenarios that
                     add new content by changing the context are given in the section titled <a href="#excepted-examples">Examples of Changes That Are Not Status Messages</a> below.

                     <li>When appropriate roles or properties are assigned to status messages, the new content
                        is spoken by screen readers in such a way as to assist blind and low vision users.
                        Most sighted users can observe text peripherally added to the viewport. Such content
                        provides additional information without affecting the user's current point of regard.
                        The ability of an assistive technology to announce such new important text content
                        allows more users to benefit from an awareness of the information in an equivalent
                        manner.

                     <li>Assigning proper roles or properties to status messages provides possible future uses
                        and personalization opportunities, such as the potential to be exploited by assistive
                        technologies created for users with some cognitive disabilities. Where page authors
                        elect to design additions to the screen which do <em>not</em> change the user's context (i.e., take focus), the information is arguably of less
                        importance than something presented using a modal dialog, which must be acknowledged
                        by the user. As such, depending on the user's preferences, an assistive technology
                        may choose to delay, suppress, or transform such messages so a user is not unnecessarily
                        interrupted; or conversely the assistive technology may highlight such messages where
                        the user finds it optimal to do so.

                           content. This text is given an appropriate role for a status message. A screen reader

                     <h3>Examples of Status Messages that Do Not Add New Text to the Screen</h3>
                     			
                     <p>This Success Criterion was intentionally worded to apply primarily when visible text
                        is added to (or becomes visible on) the page. The reason for this is that where new
                        text is displayed, it is intended to be visible to all users. By providing a programmatic
                        means of ensuring the text is also surfaced through assistive technologies, the Success
                        Criterion provides the same information to users who cannot or may not see it. However,
                        not all changes to content involve the addition of text to the screen. The following
                        are all considerations relevant to this Success Criterion:
                     </p>

                        <li>Removal of status text; and</li>
                        
                        <li>Non-textual status content, such as images.</li>
                        				
                     </ul>

                        <h4>Non-displayed text specific to AT users</h4>
                        		
                        		
                        <p>There may be cases where the addition of visible text does not by itself convey sufficient
                           information to the user of assistive technology. For example, the proximity of new
                           content to other pieces of information on the screen may provide a visual context
                           that is lacking in the text alone.
                        </p>
                        		
                        <p>In such cases, authors may wish to designate additional content for inclusion in the
                           status message, including non-displayed text which can be provided to the assistive
                           technologies, for added context. Important considerations regarding the appropriate
                           use of such techniques are further discussed in the Sufficient Techniques.

                        <h4>Modification of status text</h4>
                        		
                        <p>If a status message persists on the page, modifications to this text are usually equivalent
                           to a new status message. An example would be a shopping cart which updates text from
                           reading "0 items" to "3 items". Typical methods of writing such changes in the page
                           content result in the entire modified text string being considered a new change, and
                           thus read by assistive technologies. However, where only the number in this string
                           was coded as an updated chunk of content, the resulting experience for screen reader
                           users could be to only hear "three", which may not be sufficient information to provide
                           context for the user. In such situations, marking the entire "3 items" string as the
                           status text would normally be a better solution. See Sufficient Techniques for more
                           discussion, including the use of <code>aria-atomic</code>. In this case it would also be a courtesy to add offscreen text such as "in shopping
                           cart" to the message.

                        <h4>Removal of status text</h4>
                        		
                        <p>In situations where status text is entirely removed, its absence may itself convey
                           information about the status. The most obvious example of this is where a message
                           is displayed that the system is "busy" or "waiting". For a sighted user, when this
                           text disappears, it is normally an indication that the state is now available. However
                           non-sighted users would be unaware of this change, unless the end of the waiting state
                           results in a change of context for the user. Where updating the visible message (e.g.,
                           to "system available") is not feasible, the use of a non-visible status message, such
                           as "system available", ensures equivalent status information is provided. See Sufficient
                           Techniques for more discussion.

                     <p>The following examples identify situations where no additional author action is necessary.
                        All cases are excepted from this Success Criterion since they do not meet the definition
                        of "status messages."

                           <p>Since the dialog takes focus, it is defined as a change of context and does not meet
                              the definition of a status message. As a result of taking focus, the new change of
                              context is already announced by the screen reader, and thus does not need to be included
                              in the scope of this Success Criterion. 
                           </p>

                           <p>Content is exposed or hidden when a user interacts with a user interface component,
                              for example expanding components such as a menu, select, accordion or tree, or selecting
                              a different tab item in a tablist.
                           </p>
                           				
                           <p>None of the resulting changes to content meet the definition of status messages. Further,
                              all components that meet the definition of a user interface component already have
                              requirements specified under <a href="name-role-value" class="sc">4.1.2 Name, Role, Value</a>, including the need to make notifications of changes to values and states available
                              to user agents, including assistive technologies. As a result, changes in state, such
                              as "expanded" or "collapsed," would be announced by the screen reader, and thus the
                              user would be alerted to the 'addition' or 'removal' of content. As such, such content
                              does not need to be addressed by this Success Criterion.

                              of an application, on the progress of a process or on the existence of errors," and

                     <p>Live regions and alerts can be usefully applied in many situations where a change
                        of content takes place which does not constitute a status message, as defined in this
                        Success Criterion. However, there is a risk of making an application too "chatty"
                        for a screen reader user. User testing should be carried out to ensure the appropriate
                        level of feedback is achieved. The Advisory Techniques provide examples of how alerts
                        or live regions can enhance the user experience.

                           messages. Its intent is to ensure that when status messages <em>are</em> displayed, they are programmatically identified in a way that allows assistive technologies
                           to present them to the user.
