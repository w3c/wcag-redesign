               <h2>Intent</h2>
               <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to make information conveyed by non-text content
                  accessible through the use of a text alternative.  Text alternatives are a primary
                  way for making information accessible because they can be rendered through any sensory
                  modality (for example, visual, auditory or tactile) to match the needs of the user.
                  Providing text alternatives allows the information to be rendered in a variety of
                  ways by a variety of user agents. For example, a person who cannot see a picture can
                  have the text alternative read aloud using synthesized speech. A person who cannot
                  hear an audio file can have the text alternative displayed so that he or she can read
                  it. In the future, text alternatives will also allow information to be more easily
                  translated into sign language or into a simpler form of the same language.

                     Note on CAPTCHA

                  <p>
                     CAPTCHAs are a controversial topic in the accessibility community. As is described
                     in the
                     paper 
                     <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/turingtest/">Inaccessibility of CAPTCHA</a>, CAPTCHAs intrinsically push the edges of human abilities in an attempt to defeat
                     automated processes. Every type of CAPTCHA will be unsolvable by users with certain
                     disabilities. However, they are widely used, and the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
                     Working Group believes that if CAPTCHAs were forbidden outright, Web sites would choose
                     not to conform to WCAG rather than abandon CAPTCHA. This would create barriers for
                     a great many more users with disabilities. For this reason the Working Group has chosen
                     to structure the requirement about CAPTCHA in a way that meets the needs of most people
                     with disabilities, yet is also considered adoptable by sites. Requiring two different
                     forms of CAPTCHA on a given site ensures that most people with disabilities will find
                     a form they can use.
                     
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p>Because some users with disabilities will still not be able to access sites that meet
                     the minimum requirements, the Working Group provides recommendations for additional
                     steps. Organizations motivated to conform to WCAG should be aware of the importance
                     of this topic and should go as far beyond the minimum requirements of the guidelines
                     as possible. Additional recommended steps include:

                        </strong>, it can be much more difficult to provide text alternatives that provide equivalent
                     information as live audio-only and live video-only content. For these types of non-text
                     content, text alternatives provide a descriptive label.

                        Sometimes a test or exercise must be partially or completely presented in non-text
                        format.
                        </strong>  Audio or visual information is provided that cannot be changed to text because the
                     test or exercise must be conducted using that sense.  For example, a hearing test
                     would be invalid if a text alternative were provided.  A visual skill development
                     exercise would similarly make no sense in text form.  And a spelling test with text
                     alternatives would not be very effective.  For these cases, text alternatives should
                     be provided to describe the purpose of the non-text content; of course, the text alternatives
                     would not provide the same information needed to pass the test.

                        Sometimes content is primarily intended to create a specific sensory experience

                     visual art etc. For such content, text alternatives at least identify the non-text
                     content with a descriptive label and where possible, additional descriptive text.
                     If the reason for including the content in the page is known and can be described

                     <strong>Sometimes there are non-text exercises that are used to prove you are human.</strong> To avoid spam robots and other software from gaining access to a site a device called
                     a CAPTCHA is used. These usually involve visual or auditory tasks that are beyond
                     the current capabilities of Web robots. Providing a text alternative to them would
                     however make them operable by Robots, thus defeating their purpose. In this case a
                     text alternative would describe the purpose of the CAPTCHA, and alternate forms using
                     different modalities would be provided to address the needs of people with different
                     disabilities.

                        Sometimes there is non-text content that really is not meant to be seen or understood
                        by the user.
                        </strong> Transparent images used to move text over on a page; an invisible image that is used
                     to track usage statistics; and a swirl in the corner that conveys no information but
                     just fills up a blank space to create an aesthetic effect are all examples of this.
                     Putting alternative text on such items just distracts people using screen readers
                     from the content on the page. Not marking the content in any way, though, leaves users
                     guessing what the non-text content is and what information they may have missed (even
                     though they have not missed anything in reality). This type of non-text content, therefore,
                     is marked or implemented in a way that assistive technologies (AT) will ignore it
                     and not present anything to the user.

                        An e-learning application uses sound effects to indicate whether or not the answers
                        are correct. The chime sound indicates that the answer is correct and the beep sound
                        indicates that the answer is incorrect. A text description is also included so that
                        people who can't hear or understand the sound understand whether the answer is correct
                        or incorrect.
