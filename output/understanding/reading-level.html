                  <p>
                     Content should be written as clearly and simply as possible. The intent of this Success
                     Criterion is:
                     
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                     
                     
                     <li>to ensure that additional content is available to aid the understanding of difficult
                        or complex text;
                        
                     </li>

                  <p>This Success Criterion helps people with reading disabilities while also allowing
                     authors to publish difficult or complex Web content. Text difficulty is described
                     in terms of the level of education required to read the text. Education levels are
                     defined according to the International Standard Classification of Education [[UNESCO]],
                     which was created to allow international comparison among systems of education.
                     
                     
                  </p>
                  <p>Difficult or complex text may be appropriate for most members of the intended audience
                     (that is, most of the people for whom the content has been created). But there are
                     people with disabilities, including reading disabilities, even among highly educated
                     users with specialized knowledge of the subject matter. It may be possible to accommodate
                     these users by making the text more readable. If the text cannot be made more readable,
                     then supplemental content is needed. Supplemental content is required when text demands
                     reading ability more advanced than the lower secondary education level—that is, more
                     than nine years of school. Such text presents severe obstacles to people with reading
                     disabilities and is considered difficult even for people without disabilities who
                     have completed upper secondary education.
                     
                  </p>
                  <p>Reading disabilities such as dyslexia make it difficult to recognize written or printed
                     words and associate them with the correct sounds. This is called "decoding" the text.
                     Decoding must be automatic in order for people to read fluently. The act of decoding
                     text word by word consumes much of the mental energy that most people are able to
                     use for understanding what they read.
                     Text that uses short, common words and short sentences is easier to decode and usually
                     requires less advanced reading ability than text that uses long sentences and long
                     or unfamiliar words.
                     
                  </p>
                  <p>The education level required to read text content (also called "readability") is measured
                     by analyzing selected passages of text from the Web page. If the Web page includes
                     text written for different purposes or different styles are used, the selected passages
                     include samples of the types of content in the Web page and the different styles in
                     which the content is written. (In many cases, the Web page contains only one kind
                     of text content—e.g., technical documentation, a legal notice, marketing material,
                     etc.—and all the content uses the same style.) 
                     
                  </p>
                  <p>Educators can also measure the education level required to read text content. For
                     example, qualified teachers can evaluate text according to local education standards
                     to determine if it requires reading ability beyond what is expected for students in
                     the last year of lower secondary education.
                     
                  </p>
                  <p>Because people's names, the names of cities or other proper names cannot be changed
                     to shorter names with fewer syllables, and because doing so or just referring to everyone
                     by pronouns can make sentences harder to understand, the success criterion specifies
                     that proper names can be ignored or removed from the text before assessing whether
                     it meets the reading ability requirement. Titles refer to the name of documents, books,
                     movies, etc. Titles are removed or ignored for the analysis because changing the words
                     in titles might make the titles easier to read but would make it impossible to understand
                     the item to which the title refers. This would make it harder to read and understand
                     the content. (e.g., a book, academic paper, article, etc.). Therefore, titles are
                     also exempted specifically. 
                     
                  </p>
                  <p>When a Web page contains multiple languages, a readability result should be calculated
                     for each language that constitutes at least 5% of the content and that is used in
                     full sentences or paragraphs (not just individual words or phrases). The overall readability
                     of the page should be judged on the language that yields the worst readability results.
                     
                     
                  </p>
                  <p>The readability of content may also be determined by applying a readability formula
                     to the selected passage. Many (though not all) readability formulas base their calculations
                     on passages of 100 words. Such formulas have been developed for many languages.  The
                     number of words in the passage is counted and the length of the words is determined
                     by counting either the number of syllables or the number of characters. Most readability
                     formulas also count the number and length of sentences. The average length of words
                     and sentences in the content is then used to calculate a readability score.  (Some
                     languages, such as Japanese, may include multiple scripts within the same passage.
                     Readability formulas for these languages may use the number and length of such "runs"
                     in their calculations.)  The result may be presented as a number (for example, on
                     a scale from 0-100) or as a grade level.   These results can then be interpreted using
                     the education levels described in the International Standard Classification of Education.
                     Readability formulas are available for at least some languages when running the spell
                     checkers in popular software if you specify in the options of this engine that you
                     want to have the statistics when it has finished checking your documents.

                        <p>According to the Open Society Mental Health Initiative, the concept of Easy to Read
                           cannot be universal, and it will not be possible to write a text that will suit the
                           abilities of all people with literacy and comprehension problems. Using the clearest
                           and simplest language appropriate is highly desirable, but the WCAG Working Group
                           could not find a way to test whether this had been achieved. The use of reading level
                           is a way to introduce testability into a Success Criterion that encourages clear writing.
                           Supplementary content can be a powerful technique for people with some classes of
                           cognitive disability.

                           and drawings of buildings illustrate architectural concepts and styles. Graphic organizers
                           are used to illustrate complex relationships, and an audio version using synthetic
                           speech is available. The metadata for each version describes the academic level of
                           the content and includes a readability score based on formulas developed for Spanish-language
                           text. The learning application uses this metadata and metadata about the students
                           to provide versions of instructional content that match the needs of individual students.

                              users who have difficulty. So different techniques are provided as sufficient techniques
                              here for authors trying to make their sites more accessible. Any numbered technique
                              or combination above can be used by a particular site and it is considered sufficient
                              by the Working Group.
