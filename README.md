Temporary repository to preview WCAG redesign work to stakeholders.
Content is copied from the main wcga directory once built there.

The previews are:

* [Techniques](https://draft-wcag-redesign.netlify.app/techniques/)
* [Understanding](https://draft-wcag-redesign.netlify.app/understanding/)
* [Netlify site](https://app.netlify.com/sites/draft-wcag-redesign/overview)

This is temporary, may break and should not be used as a reference.

## Background 

The [w3c/wcag](https://github.com/w3c/wcag) repository outputs Techniques, Understanding and other pages. The WCAG Supporting Documents Redesign Project aims to refresh the UI and make it easier to use.

## What's this repo?

This repository exists to make it easier to preview updates. Files in this repository are created locally using the build system in the [WCAG repository]((https://github.com/w3c/wcag)), then updated in this repository, so that a preview can be served.
